BWA electrical is fully insured and has 10+ years experience.\n\nSee what people say about us and our work:\n\n\"Excellent electrician, Good price and outstanding work. I was really impressed with Ben's knowledge and customer service. Cleaned up as he went along and did an amazing job of fitting a brand new fuse board along with garden lighting design and install\" G J Gardener\n\n\"Great service from BWA Electrical, very prompt was here within the hour off calling for emergency electrical works. Highly recommend them and their first class service\" M Wilcox\n\n\"BWA Electrical completed a full re-wire and re-fitting on our second floor electrical circuit. This included new fittings, holes, lights etc for 3 rooms. Their work was second to none. Faultless experience, helpful advice when choosing product and they were very tidy, efficient and polite. Highly recommended for any domestic or commercial needs.\" Alex J Jones\n\n\"Outstanding work from the guys at BWA they where polite and courteous. They gave us a quote before work started which me and my wife were happy with. Their work was of a very high standard and we were both very satisfied with it. They left out house tidy and clean after work was completed and where very conscientious about Covid-19 safety. We will be booking BWA again for more electrical works soon.\" L Woodall",
